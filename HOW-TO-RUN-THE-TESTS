You need two things in addition to vanilla Ant to run the testcases:
JUnit and ant-testutil.jar.

ant-testutil.jar
----------------
This is included in the source distribution for ant-contrib in the
directory "test/lib".

junit-3.8.1.jar
----------------
This file will be automatically downloaded from http://www.ibiblio.org
and placed in the directory "test/lib".  If it is already present on
your computer, then you may copy it to this directory to avoid having
it downloaded.


JUnit can be found at http://www.junit.org and should be on any
developer's disk anyway.


Finally, all you have to do, is to run the "test" target.
